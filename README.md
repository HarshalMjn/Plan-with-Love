## Overview

This React-based app is designed to provide you with a tour itinerary exploration experience. With the help of the app, you can explore different tours, their descriptions, prices, and even remove tours that don't pique your interest. If you've seen all the available tours and want to start anew, there's a 'Refresh' button that brings back all the tours for you to rediscover.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

## Features

- **Tour Display**: The app displays a list of tours, each with an image, name, description, and price.
- **Not Interested**: If you're not interested in a particular tour, you can click the 'Not Interested' button, and the tour card will be removed from the list.
- **Refreshing**: When all tours have been explored and removed, a 'No Tours Left' message will appear. Clicking the 'Refresh' button will bring back all the tours for another round of exploration.

## How It Works

- The app uses the `useState` hook to manage the list of tours dynamically.
- The `removeTour` function is called when the 'Not Interested' button is clicked. It filters out the tour with the provided `id` and updates the list.
- When no tours are left, the UI displays the 'No Tours Left' message and offers a 'Refresh' button to bring back the tours.

## Explore and Enjoy

Whether you're a travel enthusiast or a React developer looking to learn and explore, this app provides a fun and interactive way to dive into React concepts. Enjoy exploring the tours and understanding how React components, state management, and user interactions come together to create a seamless experience.

Happy touring!"
